# Components are Important

- Keep in mind: Angular is a JS framework, changing your DOM ('HTML') at runtime

- Components are a key feature of angular
- You build the whole application by composing it from a couple of components, which you create on your own
- the app component or root component holds your entire application in the end 
- you add or nest all your other components to the HTML file of the app component

For example:
- header component
- main area component
- sidebar component

Each component has its own template/HTML code, styling, and business logic
- allows you to split up a complex application into reusable parts, so you can replicate styling and business logic
- you don't have to crunch everything into one file
