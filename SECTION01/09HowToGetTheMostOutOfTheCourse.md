# How to get the Most out of the Course

- Watch the videos
- Do the assignments: challenging, but doable
- Do the course Project: 
    - pause the video and try to implement the feature first before we do it together
    - expand the course project and add new features
- Ask in the Q&A, and also answer other peoples questions in the Q&A section (doesn't matter if it is the best possible solution)
- Offical documentation and Google to get solutions to error messages
