# What is Angular?

- a JavaScript Framework that allows you to create reactive `Single-Page-Applications (SPAs)`
- SPA
    - the URL changes as you navigate around, but the page never changes
    - only 1 HTML file + a bunch of JS code we got from the server
    - every change is rendered in the browser
    - gives the user a very reactive experience
    - JS is much faster than having to reach out to a server for every page change and every new piece of data you want to display
    - allows you to create web applications that look and feel like mobile applications: very fast
    - if you do need data from the server, you load it in the background, so user never leaves reactive experience
    - every click just changes one HTML page
    - JS changes the DOM, whatever is displayed here, changes the HTML code during runtime
    - so you never see the refresh icon spin, because we're only changing the currently loaded page
    - if you inspect the source code, you can see the html file with only one element
