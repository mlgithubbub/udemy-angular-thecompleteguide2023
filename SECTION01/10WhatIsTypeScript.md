# What is TypeScript?

- a superset to JavaScript
    - offers more features than vanilla JS: Types, Classes, Interfaces, etc.
    - in TypeScript you define the data types of variables
    - in vanillaJS you have `dynamic typing`... you can create a string variable and then assign a number to it, in TS you will get an error and code is checked at the time you write it instead of the time you run it
- TypeScript doesn't run in the browser and is compiled to JavaScript in the end
- The compilation is handled by the CLI and is very fast
