# Course Structure

1. Getting Started
2. The Basics
    - What are components?
    - What is two-way data binding? How does it work?
    - How are all the files in the project connected to each other?
3. Components and Databinding
    - Angular apps are built up from components
    - Data binding: how you output data in your DOM or react to user events
4. Directives
    - for example ngModel
    - built-in directives
    - build your own directives: instructions you can place in your templates, in your HTML code
5. Services & Dependency Injection
    - core feature of Angular
    - helps different parts of app communicate with each other, to centralize code, and manage the state of your application
6. Routing
    - management of different URLs, so to the user it looks like we are switching pages, but we are actually staying on the same page
7. Observables
    - makes more sense after learning about routing
    - concept that allows you to work with asynchronous code
8. Forms
    - handling forms/user input is a key task of any application
9. Pipes
    - feature that makes it easy for you to transform output (what you display on the template at run-time)
10. Http
    - how to reach out to a web server, how to store data in a database-- Angular can't do this directly
    - it can connect to a server that can do this
11. Authentication
    - what does it mean in an angular application?
    - let's implement authentication in an angular application
12. Optimizations & NgModules
    - look at some optimizations we can put in place and how we can manage modules in our application
13. Deployment
    - learn how to deploy angular application from our local machine to a place in the internet where we can view it
14. Animations & Testing

Besides that, we will build a real project and put all of these things into practice!
