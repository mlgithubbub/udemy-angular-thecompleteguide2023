# Angular VS Latest Version

- AngularJS (Angular 1) : not future-proof, fundamental flaws

- 2016: Angular 2, totally different framework
- Angular 3 was skipped for internal reasons
- Angular 4-16, etc. Versions 2-16 all similar, just huge difference between 1 & 2
- Angular teams releases new version every 6 months, the changes from version to version are minor and each version is backwards compatible
- So we usually don't refer to Angular by its version number, we just distinguish between Angular and AngularJS (Angular 1)
